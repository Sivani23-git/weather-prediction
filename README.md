# weather-prediction
This project demonstrates how to analyze historical weather data and predict future temperature trends using both traditional machine learning (Linear Regression) and deep learning (LSTM) models.


Features
Load or generate weather (temperature) data
Visualize historical temperature trends
Predict future temperatures using:
✅ Linear Regression (classic ML)
✅ LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network)
Data scaling and sequence generation for time series modeling
Plots for comparison of actual vs predicted values


Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
TensorFlow (Keras)
Google Colab for execution
